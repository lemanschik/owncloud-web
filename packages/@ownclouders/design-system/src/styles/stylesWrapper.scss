// We import "styles" automatically in every component
// via css.preprocessorOptions.scss.additionalData but strip
// it after the file has been processed. That's why we we need to
// include it once more globally - to make global rules available.
// If we try to just load "styles.scss" from index.html, Vite
// complains that the file is already loaded.
// Hence this wrapper file exists to workaround that behavior.
@import "styles"
